Building a machine vision inference application using ML.NET and TensorFlow for classifying images. This program imports an already-trained binary image classification model (trained using Keras and Tensorflow with Python in another project) and uses
that classification model to identify any of a set of images of powerline insulators as either "broken" or "not broken". More details and images below:
