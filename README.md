# VisualStudio_MachineVisionDemo
Simple project to solve a binary image classification problem using a CNN (convolutional neural net) that classifies power line insulators as either "broken" or "not broken". Uses Emgu CV and Tensorflow with Keras, all in Visual Studio using C#.

Below is a normal power line insulator, somewhere in China:

And below is an artificially generated "abnormal" insulator:
